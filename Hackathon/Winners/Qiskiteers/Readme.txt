The images named bitwise, chunked and normal denote the number counts in ranges of 1000 to demonstrate the degree of uniformity in the generation.

The file Circuit_design.ipynb contains the code for designing the quantum circuit and comparison with the conventional(normal) form.

The file Error_mitigation.ipynb denotes the error mitigation techniques applied to a 4-qubit circuit and demonstrates the effectiveness of the error mitigation techniques over no mitigation in the circuit deployed over a IBM QPU.

There is also a video presentation and a pdf report of the overview of the submission agenda and methodology.
